# url-exchange
* Comparing GPTJ with GPT3 using some prompt engineering.
* Introduce something called a 'URL-Exchange.'

## History
* In 2020 I worked on my thesis project that included some experiments with GPT2. These models were installed on Raspberry Pi computers. This code was mostly python. Speech to text and text to speech were attempted.
* Subsequently to that I have a private github repo for GPTJ and other relatively sized GPT models. These models were generally hosted by some company on-line and accessed using web fetch-like commands. This repo used javascript and electron for a gui. This project was ported to android.
* Still later I have attempted a chatbot that uses BERT. This is a departure from the GPT projects. The chat-bert project uses hard coded responses to many questions. It is not Auto-generative. It is comparable to AIML, but because the project uses BERT, the input prompt need not match the saved prompt completely. You can find more on this at the project repo. BERT is a smaller model when compared to GPT3.
* This repo is similar to the 'electron' repo, in that it is used with GPTJ and GPT3 on line. I am interested in comparing GPTJ and GPT3 and trying out various experiments, the most interesting being the 'URL-Exchange,' as described below.
